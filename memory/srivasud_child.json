  "prescriber_response": "Based on the information provided, the child seems to primarily experience anxiety related to school and school work, as well as anticipatory anxiety before challenges such as tests or examinations. The child does not exhibit signs of introversion, shyness, sensitivity to ridicule, obsessive thinking, or behaviours. They also do not worry about things outside their control, show signs of perfectionism, or have fears that arise from their imagination.\n\nFrom the context provided, the homeopathic remedy that seems most suitable is Calc carb. This remedy is typically beneficial for children who experience anxiety when they go to school and around their school work. These children are often methodical learners who need structure but may be slow to learn and assimilate information, leading to anxiety. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that homeopathic treatment is highly individualized, and the best remedy would be chosen based on a comprehensive understanding of the child's overall health, personality, and specific symptoms. Therefore, it would be helpful to know more about the child's general health, lifestyle, and personality traits, as well as any other symptoms they may be experiencing.",
